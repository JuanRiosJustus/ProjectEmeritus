Say we have Strength Stat. It can be influenced by equipment, skills, passives, etc. Has starting value.


STARTING STRENGTH VALUE: 7 (BASE) 0 (MODDED)

Every additional added value not from level up is considered non-base modifier.

Say we add armor that increases the value. How will that look?
 - Will the value be multiplicative or additive?
 - How is that value represented in a map?

Represent with a map, where the;
 - the source of the stat mod is the key
 - the value is a tuple array. First value is modification type, second is value
